I am a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Aeronautics & Astronautics, [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in West Lafayette, IN. I concluded my doctoral degree in aeronautics & astronautics from Purdue University. Before joining Purdue, I completed my master's degree in aerospace engineering from [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) in Auburn, AL.

My general research interests lie in modeling thermochemical nonequilibrium and rarefied flows.
